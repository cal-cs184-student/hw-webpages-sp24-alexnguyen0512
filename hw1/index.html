<h1 align="middle">Homework 1: Rasterizer</h1>
<h2 align="middle">Alex Nguyen</h2>

<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>This homework explored the basic mechanism of graphics rasterization, transforms, and texture mapping by building
  a functional image parser that can render polygons with arbitrary shape and orientation, as well as map onto them
  custom textures/images.</p>
<p>
  The from-scratch implementation of rasterization really shows how the simple geometric logic of point sampling and
  line equation checks can be used to effincitly to render graphics on a grid of pixel. 
  The most interesting takeaway from this homework is the internalization of graphics as simply a connected host of
  data structure of color values and coordinates, and how flexible that implementation is to operations like
  linear transformations and upgrades like supersampling to combat aliasing.
</p>
<p>The biggest challenge of this project was to get used to C++ syntax and pointer logic again, but 
  once that review is done, the implementation was quite straight-forward by simply following the mathematical
  frameworks introduced in lecture.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>
<p>Triangles are rasterized by sampling a grid of points and testing each points using the line 
  equation constructed from the triangles' vectices as described in lecture.
  If the sampled point is "above" all 3 edges of the triangle, that point is decidedly 
  inside the triangle and can be filled with the triangle's color value.
</p>
<p>To make sure our line equation tests are consistent, we need to establish a consistent winding
  order for the vertices. This is done by a quick line equation check before rasterization 
  and reordering the vertices so that they are ordered in a clockwise direction.
</p>
<p>Finally, to fill a pixel, one simply pass in the selcted fillcolor of the triangle into the framebuffer
  location associated with that pixel (as 3 float rgb values)
</p>
<p>To make sure the line equation checks are efficient and to eliminate uncessary samples,
  for each triangle, only the pixels within its bonding box are sampled. That is the box
  bounded by (min_x(vertices), min_y(vertices)), (min_x(vertices), max_y(vertices)),
  (max_x(vertices), min_y(vertices)), (max_x(vertices), max_y(vertices)), which can be used 
  to define the limits of the nested sampling loop.
</p>
<p>Here is the screenshot of some test redering of svg files in the svg/basic folder
  with the pixel inspector centered on a the sharpest edge in test 4, 
  showing signs of aliasing due to the fast changing signal.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>
<p>Supersampling is implemented by using an intermediary, higher-resolution sample buffer
  before rendering to the frame buffer. The sample buffer is sample_rate times larger than
  the frame buffer and stores sample_rate amount of values per frame pixel.
</p>
<p>Let s be our sample rate. For each pixel location in the frame, the algorithm sample at s 
  evenly spaced location within the pixel. This is implemented by a nested loop over sqrt(s) in each
  direction that dissect each pixel area into a sqrt(s) * sqrt(s) grid. The sampling method
  at each sub_grid location is the same as above, using line_equation checks and filling in the appropriate
  sample_buffer locations. 
</p>
<p>Here, each subgrid is also organized in the sample buffer in consecutive 1D arrays to make downsampling simpler.
  Before the values can be rendered to the (smaller) framebuffer, each subgrid need to be averaged into one color value
  per pixel. This is done by simply adding up each pixel's r, g, and b values in the subgrid and dividing by sample_rate.
</p>
<p>What this algorithm does is essentially increasing the rate of point sampling so that it can better capture fast changing
  signals like sharp edges and corners. As seen in the pixel inspector printout below, the sharp edge in test4 is 
  blurred when zoomed in, representing the sub_grid averaging that happens before rendering, and gives the impression of a cleaner
  line, with less jaggies.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Transforms</h3>
<p>Transforms are done by defining a set of 3x3 matrixes that can scale, rotate, and translate
  homogeneous coordinates in our 2D space. The construction of these matrices follow basic linear
  algebra intuitions discussed in lecture.
</p>
<p>Below shows a rendering of a transformed image of the robot given for this task.
  Additional (hierachical) tranformation steps were added to the svg file to move the robots arms and 
  head to give the impression of a waving gesture, with one arm on the hip and a tilted head.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
<p>Barycentric coordinates describe the position of a coordinate relative to a set of vertices (in this case,
  those of the triangle in which the point lies). It's a degenerate coordinate system that encodes how far the point
  is from each vertex, thus naturally serves as weights for averaging the pixel values of the vertexes,
  providing a smoother alternative to simply choosing the nearest vertex.
  This allows for linear interpolation across
  triangles and consequently rendering of gradients as seen in test7 below.
</p>
<p>An additional triangle svg file was also generated to demonstrate the interpolation effect of using 
  barycentric coordinates. The relative r, g, and b values at each location literally represents its relative distance
  to the red, green, and blue vertices, respectively
</p>

</div>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
<p>Pixel sampling is done by mapping each pixel (x,y) location to a (u,v) coordinate in texture space.
  Because we need a smooth 1-to-1 mapping, the natural choice is to use the barycentric coordinates
  implemented in the last section to map each pixel location to the (weighted) average of the texel locations
  of its triangle's vertices.
</p>
<p>Once the texture coordinate is calculated, we need to sample the texture image at that location and map its
  color value back to the sample buffer. The two choices for that are nearest pixel sampling and bilinear sampling.
</p>
<p>In nearest pixel sampling, one simply rounds the float (u,v) coordinate to its closest interger texel locaiton
  and select that value for the mapping. When using bilinear sampling, one instead uses the same logic of barycentric
  coordinate to linearly interpolate between the nearst 4 texels, in this case, done with 3 lerp function calls.
  (2 calls to linearly interpolate in one direction and another to interpolate between those values to get interpolation in 2D)
</p>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>In the above grid, one can see the anti-aliasing power of bilinear sampling compared to nearst sampling.
  In the fast-changing signals around the campanile's windows nearst sampling has a hard time mapping the fine
  details without artifacts like jaggies around edges. Bilinear interpolation helps reduce these effects
  even without using the more memory-intesive method of super sampling.
</p>
<p>Just like supersampling, bilinear interpolation will show the most dramatic improvement over nearest sampling
  when there are very fast changing signals in the texture map.
