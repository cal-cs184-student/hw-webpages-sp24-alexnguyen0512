<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>This homework focuses on the calculation and traversal of 3D surfaces/meshes using geometric algorithms and
	data structures. From interpolating Bezier curves in 1D, this was expanded to high dimension to interpolate over
	surfaces, rendering smooth 3D objects in space. Then, these surfaces were then represented with the half-mesh data
	structure to support efficient mesh traversal and local operations on the mesh such as calculating normal vector
	for smooth shading and upsampling for higher-resolution rendering.
</p>
<p>Overall, we've built a general application capable of modeling 3D mesh surfaces with variable resolution, glued together
	by the half-edge structure that can be easily navigated and operated upon. The most interesting takeaway from this endevaor
	has been understanding the value and simplicity of that half-edge data structure in working with these large meshes with
	overwhelmingly large and interconnected data. Specifically, in implementing the local operations (edge flips/splits),
	one can really appreciate the connection between these mesh elements.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>
<p>
	de Castelian's algorithm is a recursive interpolation algorithm used to calculate a point on the Bezier curve defined by
	a set of control points. The recursion works by repeatedly applying the lerp function pairwise to the set of n control
	points to obtain n-1 points, with which the algorithm repeats until 1 point remains. 
</p>
<p>It is implemented by a recursive function, each recursion level of which represents a subdivision level in de Castelian's 
	algorithm and calls a helper evaluation function that performs lerp pairwise.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<p>For surfaces (2D), de Casteljau works by separating the two dimensions and applying the algorithm sequentially in each.
	First, the control points (m x n) are organized into rows, essenstially into m independent Bezier curves. 1D de Casteljau
	can then be applied separately to each of these sets of n control points, each yielding one control point evaluated at t.
	These m control points defined another Bezier curve in the other dimension, on which de Casteljau can then be applied again
	to calculate a final evaluation point at parameter t on the original surface. 
	This two-fold application is why it's called "Separable 1D".
</p>
<p>Below is an example of a surface evaluated by this algorithm</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>
<p>To achieve a better shading function on smooth surfaces (Phong shading), we need the normal vectors at each vertex in the
	mesh, normalized and weighted by the area of its corresponding face. This can be computed by a complete 
	vertex traversal through the mesh.
</p>
<p>Using the connectedness of the hald-edge data structure, one can traverse around each vertex to get all of each neighbors.
	The difference between each neighbor coordinates and the original vertex gives outgoing edge vectors, the cross products 
	of which gives another vector normal to the face defined by said edges. The norm of this cross product also gives the area
	of that face, which can be used to weight the normal vectors. The sum of the normal vectors calculated around a vertex is then
	normalized at the end, which gives an approximate unit normal at each vertex.
</p>
<p>One debugging issue encountered during this implementation is the direction of these cross products, which depends on the winding order
	or our vertex traversal loop. If pointed in the wrong direciton, the resulting shading gets really dark, which was fixed by simply
	flipping the sign of the cross products before summation. Below is an image of the teapot rendered with flat shading (left) and 
	Phong shading (right) with a marked difference in smoothness.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<p>The edge flipping implementation was done by following the pseudocode in lecture and the suggestions provided in the assignment.
	By simply drawing out a simple test case of two adjacent triangles before and after an edge flip, with all of its mesh elements
	and corresponding half-edges laid out, one can form a 1-1 mapping between old and new pointers that help with the complicated pointer
	reassignments needed for this operation.
</p>
<p>One thing that really helped with implementing this and during debugging was a systematic naming strategy for the different mesh-elements,
	directly corresponding to those defined in our small test example (4 points, 4 edges, 2 faces). By first assigning these elements to 
	carefully-named variables and access them relatively through the reference edge (e0), we get a pretty defined idea 
	of what's going on with each element during this operation, which makes reassigning their pointers much easier. The helper function 
	check_for was also used extensively to check the correct number of assignments are done to half-edges.
</p>
<p>Below is the image of the teapot with some randomly placed edge flips. Note that certain flipping operations caused dents in the surface
	as shown, which is expected due to the curved nature of the surface.

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Splits</h3>
<p>Similar to edge flips, the procedure for implementing edge splits also involved first a systematic naming of each old and new mesh elements 
	according to a small test case drawn out on paper. Unlike flipping, however, edge splitting requires new elements to be added to the mesh 
	(2 new faces, 3 new edges, 1 new vertex, and 6 new half_edges). Each of these elements and their pointers need to assigned more carefully,
	as the order of adding them matters to prevent segmentation errors. However, the same method applies of following exactly the mapping from
	the old to new mesh according to the small test case.
</p>
<p>The mid point (new vertex) that gets added on the splitting edge need to first be defined with its position being the average of the 
	edge's vertices and its half-edge pointer assigned to the edge's half edge. Then sequentially, each element gets assigned to a systematically
	named variable, and accessed via half-edge references relative to the edge passed in (e0). One by one, the get reassigned, and new elements is
	added via the mesh's built-in functions (newVertex, newFace, etc.) as needed.
</p>
<p>All 12 half-edges are then redefined one by one via the setNeighbor method, the order of which matters somewhat in making sure elements are being
	accessed only through previously reassigned elements. Additionally, the isNew tag is added to the new midpoint vertex, as well as newly added edges
	in order to support upsampling later on.
</p>
<p>Debugging in this part was tricky, due to the sheer number of pointers to manage, but due to the naming convention, it was relatively easy to identify,
	which face/vertex/edge was buggy.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<p>The loop subdivision algorithm was broken down into 5 steps for clearer implementation (as supposed to the suggested 3)</p>
<li><b>Step 1:</b> Calculating the new position of each exisiting vertex. This is done via a complete vertex traversal through the mesh.
	At each vertex, a neighbor traversal loop is done, collecting the position of each neighbor, summing them up and adding it to the 
	center vertex position with the weighting scheme provided in lecture. The final weighted sum is stored in vertex->newPosition.
	Also, the is_new tag is set to false for all existing vertex.
</li>
<li><b>Step 2:</b> Calculating the new position of to-be-added vertices at the midpoint of every edge. Since there will be a new vertex added at every
	edge due to the splitting, this can be done by simply traversing through every edge in the existing mesh. At every edge, the sum of 
	its vertices' positions as well as the sum of the remaining vertices of its adjacent faces are added up, weighted by the scheme 
	given in lecture. This is also stored in each edge->newposition. Additional, the is_new tag is also set to false for every exisiting edge.
</li>
<li><b>Step 3:</b> Iterate over all edges in the mesh (again) and splitting everything. To prevent infinitely looping over a chaning edge list 
	(due to new edges being added with every split operation), only edges connecting two old (is_new = False) vertices are to be split.
	Remember that new edges/vertices are being created during splitting and their is_new tag is set to True. Also, as edge_split returns
	a pointer to the new midpoint vertex created during the split, this pointer can be used to set that vertex->newposition to the
	precalculated position stored in edge->newposition.
</li>
<li><b>Step 4:</b> Iterate over all edges (again) and splitting new edges connecting a new and old vertex. This is done by simply checking the is_new
	tag of each edge as well as its endpoint vertices.
</li>
<li><b>Step 5:</b> Iterate over all vertices in the modified mesh and setting their position to newPosition. At this point, every vertex old and new
	is guarenteed to have a set newPosition attribute due to the order of operations above, so updating positions is quite simple.
</li>

  <p>Note that in the cube mesh, corners and edges becomes assymetric after a few upsampling steps and remains points of non-smoothness
	in the subdivided mesh. Intuitively, this would be curbed by preprocessing the cube with some edge splits and flips 
	at the edges and corner before subdividing.
	An example of which where edges around one corner is split before upsampling is shown below:
  </p>
  <div align="middle">
	<table style="width=100%">

		  <figcaption align="middle">Cube Mesh - With Pre-Splitting Edges Around a Corner</figcaption>
		</td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
  </div>
  <p>Preprocessing does not seem to help with this corner problem. This is due to the fact that special vertices in a mesh is a provable
  inevitability and these seem to occur at the corners of the cube.</p>
  <p>The same goes for the assymetry problem. No combination of edge splits/flips before upsampling seems to alleviate the assymetry of the 
	upsampled mesh. In most cases, it makes it worse.
